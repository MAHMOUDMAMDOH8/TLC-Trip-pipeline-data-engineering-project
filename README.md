The TLC-Trip Pipeline Data Engineering Project aims to conduct comprehensive data analytics on TLC (Taxi and Limousine Commission) trip data using a variety of tools and technologies. By leveraging Postgres, Python, Compute Instance, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, Power BI, and Docker, the project aims to extract valuable insights from TLC trip data for informed decision-making and operational optimizations.

## Project Objectives
Data Acquisition: Extract TLC trip data from relevant sources, ensuring data integrity and security.

Data Storage: Design and implement a robust Postgres database schema optimized for efficient storage and retrieval of TLC trip data.

Data Processing: Utilize Python for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, ensuring data quality and consistency.

Compute Instance: Provision Compute Instance resources for scalable computing power to handle large volumes of TLC trip data.

Data Pipeline: Implement a robust data pipeline using the Mage Data Pipeline Tool for automating data workflows, including data ingestion, transformation, and loading.

Visualization: Utilize Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports for visualizing key insights and trends derived from TLC trip data.

Containerization: Employ Docker for containerizing the entire data analytics workflow, ensuring portability and reproducibility across different environments.
